    "# Semester Project: Discovery of the Higgs Boson in the Decay Process \n",
    "\\(H \\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4\\ell\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course**: PHYS32300  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor**: Prof. Andreas Jung \n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: Santosh Bhandari, David Ruiter\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will reconstruct the discovery of the Higgs boson in the \\(H \\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4\\ell\\) decay process. The Higgs decays into two Z bosons, and each Z boson subsequently decays into a pair of leptons (\\(e^+e^-\\) or \\(\\mu^+\\mu^-\\)). Your task is to analyze three different channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(4e\\) (four electrons)\n",
    "- \\(4\\mu\\) (four muons)\n",
    "- \\(2e2\\mu\\) (two electrons and two muons)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will have successfully plotted the signal and background processes for each channel and produced a combined final plot showing the Higgs boson signal in the \\(H \\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4\\ll\\) process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Provided\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal File**:  \n",
    "  `/home/bhanda25/Phys323_fall2024/Root_files/SMHiggsToZZTo4L.root`  \n",
    "  This file contains simulated Higgs boson events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Background Files**:  \n",
    "  - `ZZTo4e.root`  \n",
    "  - `ZZTo2e2mu.root`  \n",
    "  - `ZZTo4mu.root`  \n",
    "  These files contain background processes that mimic the Higgs boson signature but arise from standard model \\(ZZ\\) production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Plot Signal vs. Background for Each Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "For each decay channel (\\(4e\\), \\(4\\mu\\), and \\(2e2\\mu\\)), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the ROOT files**: Use the provided template code for the \\(4e\\) channel as a reference to load the signal and background files for each decay channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply the Selection Criteria**:  \n",
    "   More info is given below\n",
    "3. **Plot the Signal vs. Background**:  \n",
    "   Create histograms for each channel (e.g., \\(4e\\), \\(4\\mu\\), and \\(2e2\\mu\\)) to compare the Higgs signal to the background processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Combine All Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the signal and background plots for each individual channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combine the Channels**:  \n",
    "   Add the signal and background contributions from the \\(4e\\), \\(4\\mu\\), and \\(2e2\\mu\\) channels to produce a final plot. This combined plot will show the discovery of the Higgs boson in the \\(H \\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4\\ll\\) process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Plot**:  \n",
    "   Your final plot should overlay the combined signal and background events to illustrate the reconstructed Higgs mass peak."
